# First thing to start with:
- Do `apt-get update -y` and `apt-get upgrade -y`

# Next is to install Docker  
- Install Docker and Docker Compose. You need to get your installation of Docker from the documentation by typing in your browser:
  "How to install Docker for Ubuntu," then follow the process and get your Docker and Docker Compose installed.

# Installation of Nginx 
- Just do:
  ```bash
  apt-get install nginx -y
Installation of the project to the terminal
Go to the repository where the project is and clone it, go back to your terminal:
bash
Copy code
git clone http://github.com/toluwani/mearn_todo.git
Then press enter; it will clone the project into your terminal.
cd into mearn_todo.
#                    Important Notifications:
Note that you must always do npm install and npm start for the backend and frontend,and npm run build for the frontend:

npm install: Installs all the packages your application needs to work with.
npm start: Starts up your application and tests it to ensure everything works fine before building the image.
npm run build: Installs all necessary dependencies for the frontend.
Proceeding with the project setup:
Use code . to open Visual Studio Code and check the project structure. Note:

Dockerfiles and .env files need to be created.
The project has separate frontend and backend images.
For the backend:

Create a Dockerfile.
Run:
npm install
npm start
Test the application first before proceeding with building the backend.
To build the backend image:
docker build -t <your-image-name> .

For the frontend
cd into the frontend directory, create a Dockerfile, and run:
npm install
npm run build
npm start
Build the frontend image:
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
For the backend .env file:

Create a cluster for your backend database.
#              HOW TO CREATE A CLUSTER FROM MONGO ATLAS
- Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Access MongoDB Atlas
Open your browser and type MongoDB Atlas in the search bar.
Go to the official MongoDB Atlas website.
2. Sign Up or Log In
If you’re new, look for the MongoDB Atlas registration page and sign up for an account.
If you already have an account, sign in.
3. Create a New Project
In the Atlas dashboard, look for New Project and click on it.
Enter a name for your project (e.g., TodoApp) and proceed by clicking "Next".
4. Build and Configure a Cluster
In your project, click "Build a Database".
Choose:
Shared Cluster (Free Tier) for basic use.
Dedicated Cluster for production-level hosting.
Select your cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).
Pick a region based on your user base for better performance.
Name your cluster (e.g., Cluster0) and proceed to create it.
5. Deploy the Cluster
Click "Create Cluster".
Wait for the cluster to finish provisioning (this may take a few minutes).
6. Configure Network Access
Navigate to "Network Access" in the left-hand menu.
Add an IP address:
Use 0.0.0.0/0 for universal access, or
Enter your specific local IP address.
Confirm your settings.
7. Set Up Database Users
Go to "Database Access" in the left-hand menu.
Add a new database user:
Username: e.g., admin
Password: e.g., password
Assign a role, such as Atlas Admin or Read/Write to any database.
8. Retrieve Your Connection String
Go to "Clusters" in the left-hand menu.
Click "Connect" next to your cluster.
Select "Connect your application" and copy the provided connection string.
9. Test Your Connection
Use the connection string in your application .env file and in Node.js.


# Project Description

## 1. Application Containerization
### Dockerize the Application
- **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository from the provided GitHub link.
- **Create Dockerfiles**:
  - Create Dockerfiles for both the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express) to containerize the application.
  - Optimize the Dockerfiles for production (e.g., multi-stage builds for React, minimal Node.js images).
### Docker Compose Configuration
- Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to define services for the backend, frontend, MongoDB, Prometheus, and other necessary components.
- Set up Docker volumes for MongoDB to ensure data persistence.

---

## 2. Docker Compose Setup
### Deploy the Application
- Use Docker Compose to define and deploy services for the frontend, backend, and MongoDB.
- Ensure services are defined with clear dependencies and network communication using Docker Compose networks.
- Create `.env` files to securely manage environment variables and use Docker Secrets for sensitive information like database credentials.
- Simulate ConfigMaps in Docker Compose using bind mounts to manage application configuration details.

---

## 3. Load Balancing with ELB
### Set up an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
- Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) on AWS to manage traffic distribution across the frontend and backend services.
- Configure the ALB to route incoming requests to the appropriate services based on path-based routing (e.g., `/frontend` and `/backend`).
- Ensure the ALB performs health checks on each service to verify availability and automatically redirect traffic if needed.

---

## 4. Networking and Data Persistence
### Docker Networking
- Use Docker Compose to create a custom network that allows all services (frontend, backend, MongoDB, etc.) to communicate.
### Data Persistence
- Use Docker volumes for MongoDB to ensure reliable data persistence.

---

## 5. Secure Ingress with SSL
### SSL Certificate
- Use AWS Certificate Manager or Certbot to generate and manage SSL certificates for the ELB.
- Secure all incoming traffic to the ELB using SSL.

---

## 6. DNS Configuration
### Route 53 Setup
- Set up AWS Route 53 to manage DNS records for the application.
- Ensure the custom domain points to the ELB’s DNS name.

---

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline
### GitHub Actions
- Set up GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment.
- The pipeline should:
  - Build Docker images for the frontend and backend.
  - Run unit tests for both frontend and backend services.
  - Push Docker images to a Docker registry (Docker Hub or ECR).
  - Deploy the application using Docker Compose on the production server by pulling updated images and running the Compose file.
  - Ensure the pipeline automatically updates the ELB configuration upon deployment.

---

## 8. Auto-Scaling with Prometheus and AlertManager
### Prometheus Setup and pushgatway
- Use Docker Compose to set up Prometheus to monitor the resource usage (CPU, memory) of the containers.
### AlertManager Setup
- Configure AlertManager to trigger alerts when resource usage exceeds a certain threshold.
- Implement scripts in the CI/CD pipeline or Compose setup to increase the number of replicas for frontend or backend services dynamically when thresholds are reached.

---

## 9. Monitoring with Portainer
### Portainer Deployment
- Deploy Portainer to visually monitor and manage the Docker containers.
- Use Portainer to track resource usage, service status, and perform real-time management.

---

## 10. Secrets and ConfigMaps
### Docker Secrets
- Set up Docker Secrets to securely store sensitive information such as MongoDB credentials.
### ConfigMaps (Simulated)
- Use Docker Compose bind mounts to simulate ConfigMaps by mounting configuration files into containers.

---

## 11. Documentation
### Document the Process
- Provide thorough documentation on the entire setup and deployment process.
- Include troubleshooting steps, performance metrics, and details of the scaling and monitoring processes.

---

## **Expected Outcome**
By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional MERN application deployed using Docker Compose, with an automated CI/CD pipeline that leverages GitHub Actions. The application will be accessible via a custom domain with SSL encryption through AWS Route 53 and ELB for load balancing. Auto-scaling will be configured with Prometheus and AlertManager. Docker Secrets and bind-mounted ConfigMaps will securely manage credentials and configuration. Portainer will be used for real-time monitoring and management of the containers, while Docker volumes will ensure MongoDB data persistence.
